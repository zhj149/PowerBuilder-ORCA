	under the same terms as Perl itself. 

	You have two ways of installation of the module:

	1. Installation of the precompiled package for ActivePerl through Perl 
	Package Manager (Recommended). Zip archives with ppm packages are placed 
	in a ppm subdirectory in my directory on CPAN.

	2. Building module from source.


BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this module from source you will need to:

	1. Install Perl 5 (I use ActivePerl 5.6 build 631)

	2. Install C ++ compiler, suitable for compilation of Perl modules (I use  
	Microsoft Visual C 6.0 with service packs)

	3. Install PowerBuilder with ORCA .dll and .lib files (I use 
	PowerBuilder 6.0 enterprise edition)

BUILDING:

	perl Makefile.PL
	nmake

	The test application located in files orca_test.pbl and orca_test2.pbl. 
	It is necessary to open it and make work in PB environment. After that 
	it is possible to start test suit:

  	nmake test
